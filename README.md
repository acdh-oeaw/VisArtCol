# visartist
Visual Artwork Analysis and Collection Tool

visartist aims to collect and process visual information as well as metadata of historically significant paintings to provide meaningful descriptive statistics and comparison charts to discover more about artworks and artists.

Please note that this project is currently at a very early experimental stage; thus there might be bugs, issues with not precisely calculated results or missing data.

All artworks and information about artworks / artists belong to the respective owners and the sources are linked with the information provided. Currently all visual data is remotely used from Wikimedia Commons.

Concept and Development: Asil Ã‡etin
