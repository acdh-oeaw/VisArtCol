      "description":"A young man looks into the world with big, questioning eyes. The eyes, the high forehead, and the bushy and unruly hair accentuate a spiritual side of the sitter. The neck supporting the oversized head appears petite and slender. Schiele sketched the boyish chest with sparse lines and painted the sleeve in shades of watercolor, which act as a compositional balance to the colors of the head.",

      "description":"The background of Schiele\u2019s Self Portrait, Standing is plain, foregrounding his fully nude body. He stands facing the viewer with his left arm twisted behind his back and his right arm bent at an odd angle. His dramatic use of line makes it look as if his skin was rubbed raw, exposing the muscle underneath. He wears a painful grimace upon his face and looks straight out at the viewer.",

      "description":"This grotesque and eerie self-depiction emerged in connection with the large format painting \u00bbThe Hermits\u00ab. Schiele adopts the head posture and the related straddled fingers. Striking here is the reoccurring accentuation of the hands and the thumb: the thumb seems not to fit into Schiele\u2019s design concept, so that he often omits it or renders it severely angled. Schiele\u2019s head is bent, the eyes turned upwards, which makes the white of the eyes appear like crescent moons in an otherwise dark face.",

      "description":"Egon Schiele was an Austrian painter. A protégé of Gustav Klimt, Schiele was a major figurative painter of the early 20th century. His work is noted for its intensity and its raw sexuality, and the many self-portraits the artist produced, including naked self-portraits. The twisted body shapes and the expressive line that characterize Schiele's paintings and drawings mark the artist as an early exponent of Expressionism.",
